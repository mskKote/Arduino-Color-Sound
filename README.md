## How does it works?

Let's make an overview:
1. ```String <String> = ColorRecognizion()``` - uses tcs3200 library for take hue, 
                                       after that my alghorithm separates 13 colors and returns color's name;   
2. ```MakeSound(<String>)``` - takes color's name and search appropriate sound tone, then plays this tone;
  
3. ```RedAlert(int alertTime=3000)``` - arises when color's name equals "Unknown" and bring to user a little time to think about that;
 
4. ```MakeTextAnimation(String message, int delayVal=25, String ending="")``` - used for make a text in console more user-friendly, allows showing animation slowler and make ending like "\n" or whatever else;
 
 
Color - in model it is RBGA, but RGB - is not a color hue, thats relevant values [All questions about it redirect to tcs3200.h]
Sound - try to use values at notes for good effect.
